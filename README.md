#  BNS  #

A corpus generator making use of HTML+RDFa and JSON-LD formats.
Requires Jekyll to build; built for use with GitHub pages.

You can create your own BNS corpus by forking this code and replacing `_data/bns.yml`.
Set the `prefix` property in `_config.yml`to match the prefix of the `@id`s of your BNS objects, including the trailing colon.
